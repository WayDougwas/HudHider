# HUD Hider

Fork of HUD Auto Hide
Origninal mod is HUD Auto Hide [Link](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/hud-auto-hide)

Only show HUD when inventory is open. Should work for mods UI as well (has been tested with MSI II and RPG System).
Manual mode, when activated, allows to hide HUD by pressing hotkey (SHIFT + E by default).
